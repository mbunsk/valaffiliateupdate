✨This is how ideas are validated in 2026 and beyond.
Are you using dated methods to validate your ideas?

🙋‍♂️ Hello! Aron here w/ ValidatorAI.com 

I am going to tell you the validation method that is your best bet for success going forward.


 
🏆 Attention is the scarce asset now.
Startup founders are building amazing things with AI - yet most are desperate for distribution help.

Here’s the secret: Validation and audience building should happen simultaneously. Test your ideas with your audience as you grow it.

The old way of starting something involved you blasting social media with your idea and hoping that someone engages with you.

✅ This is the key change we’re making: Instead of pushing people to hear us out, we’re pulling them in with something they want to try right now.  

Below is the best way to validate new ideas…

 
1️⃣ Create Your AI Tool Magnet
Interactive AI tools attract your future customers.

Your first job: create AI-powered playable or personalized content your target audience finds interesting and helpful. Do this by creating an AI tool they would love to use.

Examples:

Calculate your [X] score

Personalized profile generator “What type of [X] are you?”

Leaderboards “Where do you rank on [X]?”

Simulations “See how your [X] ranks in the market”

Fun quizzes with sharable results and leaderboards

Key Rule: Your tool should give your audience something to do, not just read or watch. Make results sharable… encourage posting of scores, rankings, or personalized reports.

Where to Build:

Bubble 

Lovable

When describing your AI tool idea on Bubble or Lovable, explain that it’s free-to-use, helpful, and designed to capture leads. Always capture emails when people use your tool… what you do next depends on that list.

 
2️⃣ Launch Your Audience Platform
Join a newsletter platform like Beehiiv or Substack. Both are free to start.
Import every tool user into your list.

Use polls, surveys, and open-ended questions in the newsletter to:

Spot which problems resonate most

Test product ideas before building

Let your audience guide and select your product development

 
3️⃣ Drive Traffic (The Audience-Building Flywheel)
Your AI tool is live, now it’s all about attention.

Short-Form Video as a Trust Layer
Post 3–5 short videos per week on TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts:

Quick wins your tool delivers

Surprising industry facts

Live demo moments “I built this AI tool that personalizes your investment strategy in 30 seconds…”

Testing random scenarios in your market with your AI tool

Stitches reacting to popular videos in your market, running them through your AI tool

End every video with: “Link in bio - try it FREE” (not “subscribe” or “sign up”).

Additional Traffic Plays:

Partner with other newsletters & creators to embed your tool (win–win: you get exposure, they get value)

Run live streams where you take audience requests and run them through your tool with live commentary

Blog, write on Medium and compose helpful LinkedIn articles

Encourage users to share their results. Every share = more eyeballs


Remember Our Mindset Shift:

Old playbook: “Let me talk about your problem so I can sell you something.”

2026 playbook: “Here’s something fun and useful you can try for free right now.”

 
4️⃣ Work Your Newsletter
Share helpful market insights

Let the audience vote on product development

Keep comments and emails open

Engage personally - send calls, videos, and messages to those who want to dive deeper

Get validation and engagement at the same time

 
5️⃣ Optimize for AI Agents
Once your landing page and tool are up:

Run our free AI Agent Readiness Test to optimize your website so AI agents pull your site as the answer.

This makes you discoverable in the AI-driven search world.

 
⚡ Here’s the Loop
Traffic flows to your tool - Build it at Bubble or Lovable

Tool collects emails into your newsletter - Signup at Beehiiv

The newsletter polls & engages audience to validate ideas

Launch new tools and develop your product based on votes

Repeat… audience size and idea accuracy grow each cycle


 

😎 Final thought…
It’s up to you to take the data you gather and decide if you actually want to pursue a business providing a solution to your audience. Your original idea will morph based on what you learn.

Take Care!
