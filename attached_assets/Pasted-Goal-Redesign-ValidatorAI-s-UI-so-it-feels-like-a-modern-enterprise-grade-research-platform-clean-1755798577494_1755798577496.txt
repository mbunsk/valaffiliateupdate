Goal

Redesign ValidatorAI’s UI so it feels like a modern, enterprise-grade research platform: clean, crisp, minimal, and premium. We want to keep our current architecture and product flow, but elevate the visual system, component quality, and brand coherence. The new design should increase trust and conversions for both SMB and enterprise buyers.

North Star

"Strategic Business Intelligence, delivered by AI in minutes" presented with a calm, confident interface that looks like a professional research suite, not a playful startup tool. Think: precise typography, generous white space, quiet gradients, subtle depth, and excellent micro-interactions.

Success Criteria (Definition of Done)

Visual polish: pages feel custom and premium, not template-based or juvenile. No emoji aesthetics. No playful rounded blobs. Minimal shadows.

Consistency: one design system across pages, with tokens for color, spacing, radii, and typography.

Clarity: scannable hierarchy, clear CTAs, tight copy, and visible trust signals.

Performance: fast first load, smooth transitions, skeleton states for network calls.

Accessibility: WCAG AA contrast, keyboard support, ARIA where needed.

Conversion: improved click-through to product views and purchases; stronger emphasis on featured product.

Tech Stack (Keep)

React + TypeScript, Vite, Wouter

Tailwind CSS

shadcn/ui for primitives

TanStack Query

Express + TypeScript backend, Drizzle + Postgres

Brand System
Color

Base neutrals: slate/zinc range, predominately on white and near-white surfaces. Accent gradient: teal → cyan → blue (very subtle) used sparingly for emphasis. Status: green for success, amber for warnings, red for errors, blue for info.

Example Tailwind tokens (can be CSS variables if preferred):

Background: bg-white, bg-slate-50, dark mode bg-slate-950

Text: text-slate-900, text-slate-600, dark text-slate-100

Accent: create a token class .text-accent and .bg-accent mapped to a gradient utility

Borders: border-slate-200 light, border-slate-800 dark

Radii: default rounded-2xl for cards, rounded-lg for inputs and buttons

Typography

Display: Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans (system-friendly, professional). If using Google, preconnect and swap.

Sizes: H1 48–56, H2 32–40, H3 24–28, body 16–18. Line-height 1.4–1.6.

Weight: avoid ultra-bold. Prefer 600 for headings, 400–500 for body.

Tight, consistent letter spacing. No gimmick fonts.

Spacing and Layout

8px baseline grid. Section padding: 64–96 top and bottom on desktop, 32–48 on mobile.

Max content width: 1200–1280px. Side gutters: 24–32px.

Use a 12-column grid for complex pages, 6-column on tablet.

Iconography

lucide-react. Thin, consistent line icons with 1.5px stroke.

Motion

Framer Motion for small interactions only: fades, slides of 100–150ms. Easing: standard Bézier. No bounce.

Core Pages and Modules
1) Global Elements

Top bar: compact height, left-aligned logo, right-aligned nav and primary CTA. Sticky after scroll.

Navigation: Home, Products, How it Works, Case Studies, Pricing, Partners, About, Sign In.

Theme toggle: simple icon toggle. Respect prefers-color-scheme. Dark theme must be fully styled.

Footer: 3 columns: Platform, Company, Legal. Include compliance badges, partner logos, social, and contact.

2) Homepage

Hero

Left: concise headline and subhead:

H1: "AI Research, Ready in Minutes"

Sub: "Market analysis, TAM, customer insights, and feasibility reports. Enterprise quality, automated."

Primary CTA: "Run a quick validation". Secondary: "View sample report".

Right: featured product card with minimal form fields and clear runtime badge.

Background: light grid pattern at 3–5% opacity with a soft accent gradient corner. No harsh glows.

Trust Row

Inline, quiet logos of notable users. Include SOC2-style badge if applicable.

Products Grid

Uniform cards with tight spec lines. Each card shows: name, price, agent count, runtime, outputs, and a discreet info icon that opens the detailed modal or links to the product page.

Primary action: "Start". Secondary: "Details".

Featured product has a tasteful accent ring or subtle gradient border.

How It Works

3 or 4 steps in a horizontal progression: Submit inputs → Agents run → Report generated → Share or iterate.

Each step has a small icon and a one-line description.

Outcomes and Savings

Short comparison against consultant pricing, with an anchored link to sample outputs.

Testimonials

Real headshots where possible, short quotes, title and company. Keep tone authentic.

Partners and Integrations

Logos with subtle hover effects. Small copy: "Validated with FifthRow agent marketplace".

3) Products Index (/products)

Filter and sort controls at the top: by price, runtime, use case.

Cards in a responsive grid. On hover, show a short 1–2 line outcome statement.

Each card: title, short description, price, runtime, agents, outputs, CTA.

4) Product Detail Page (and Modal)

We need both a sharable page for SEO and a modal trigger from the grid.

Breadcrumbs: Home → Products → [Product]

Above the fold: title, summary, price, runtime, output formats, "Start" CTA.

Tabs below: Overview, Agent Breakdown, Inputs, Sample Output, FAQs.

Agent Breakdown: simple table with agent name, purpose, and dependencies.

Inputs: form with clear labels, helper text, validation on blur.

Sample Output: collapsed sections with toggles for PDF preview thumbnails and a link to a public sample.

Sticky purchase module on desktop, bottom dock on mobile.

5) Checkout

Stripe-ready layout with summary on the right, form on the left.

Order review: product, price, ETA, file formats, data use disclaimer.

Trust icons near the button. Keep it lean.

6) Reports

Public link view has a minimal document viewer look: sidebar with sections, main reading pane, export buttons.

Clear "Share" control, copy-link tooltip, and a small banner that this is an example if applicable.

7) Admin Analytics (/aron)

Professional table styles, sticky headers, compact density option.

Filters: product, date range, UTM source, partner.

Charts: single-series line or bar charts. No heavy styling. Titles and axes labeled.

Export CSV and copy-to-clipboard buttons.

Components and States

Buttons: primary (accent), secondary (outline), tertiary (ghost). Disabled styles distinct. Loading spinners inside buttons.

Cards: rounded-2xl, 1px border, very light shadow at rest, slightly stronger on hover.

Inputs: large click targets, 44px min height. Clear placeholder, helper text, and validation messages.

Badges: small, pill-shaped for runtime and agent count.

Tables: clean, 1px grid, zebra optional, sticky header on long lists.

Empty states: icon, one-line explainer, and a primary CTA.

Skeletons: for product cards, hero form, and tables.

Toasts: non-intrusive, bottom-right, auto-dismiss.

Modals/Drawers: narrow focus, clear close affordance, escape-to-close enabled.

Copy and Tone

Confident and specific, never hypey. Avoid jargon unless it helps buyers evaluate.

Use short sentences and bullet points. Lead with outcomes and evidence.

Always clarify what the user will receive: PDF, PowerPoint, public link, ETA.

Example hero copy

H1: "AI Research, Ready in Minutes"

Sub: "Replace multi-week consultant work with automated reports: market size, customer insights, feasibility, and more."

Primary CTA: "Run a quick validation"

Example product card copy

Title: "New Product Feasibility Study"

Spec line: "10 agents, ~49 min, PDF + PPT + share link"

CTA: "Start"

FifthRow Integration UX

Before run: clearly show agent count and estimated time. Make it obvious that multiple agents collaborate.

During run: progress steps with plain text status, not cute loading animations. Provide time estimates and the ability to cancel.

After run: clear confirmation, links to outputs, and a suggested next action.

Trust and Compliance

Place SOC2-like compliance badge near pricing and in footer. If not certified yet, phrase carefully: "Enterprise security standards" and describe data handling in the privacy page.

Testimonials: keep the authentic ones. Use names, roles, and company where allowed.

Partner logos: Bubble, Beehiiv, LivePlan, Gamma, Miro, Notion, Augment. Keep them quiet and tasteful.

SEO and Meta

Titles and meta descriptions for all product pages. OG images per product with the new visual system.

Structured data for products (price, time to deliver, output types).

Fast LCP: optimize hero image assets and any background graphics.

Accessibility

All interactive elements reachable and usable by keyboard.

Focus states visible. Skip link available.

Color contrast AA or better.

Labels on all inputs. ARIA where appropriate.

Performance Targets

LCP under 2.5s on 3G Fast. CLS under 0.1. TTI under 3.5s.

Code splitting by route and by heavy module.

Optimize and lazy load any non-critical images or charts.

Design System Delivery

Create a small tokens file and a style guide page under /design with live components and examples: buttons, cards, forms, tables, badges, toasts, modals.

Provide a tokens JSON for colors, radii, spacing, and typography that Tailwind can consume.

Document usage rules: when to use which button, card variants, and spacing utilities.

Component Inventory (shadcn/ui preferred)

Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Tabs, Accordion, Dialog, Drawer, Tooltip, Badge, Card, Table, Toast, Progress.

Compose advanced components from primitives rather than custom one-offs where possible.

Layout Examples (high level)

Hero: 2-column at desktop: 6/6 split. On mobile, vertical stack. Right column is the featured product card with form. Products grid: 3 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile. Equal height cards. Product page: left content column 8, right sticky purchase column 4 on desktop. Single column on mobile.

Visual Do and Do Not

Do: quiet gradients, subtle grid, crisp borders, lots of breathing room, careful micro-interactions.

Do not: emojis, bright cartoon colors, heavy drop shadows, rounded blob shapes, overcrowded content.

QA Checklist

All pages in both light and dark theme look intentional and polished.

Hover, focus, active, loading, and error states exist for every interactive element.

Product detail pages have SEO-friendly URLs and unique OG images.

Forms validate gracefully and explain what went wrong.

Featured product is visually distinct but still minimal.

Admin analytics table handles 1k+ rows smoothly with virtualization if needed.

Deliverables

Implemented components and pages with the new design system.

Tokens and /design style guide page.

Updated OG images for homepage and all product pages.

Documentation notes in README explaining design decisions and usage.

Notes from Business Context (for alignment)

Audience shift toward decision-makers evaluating paid research outputs.

Value prop: replace expensive, slow consultants with fast, reliable AI research.

Must preserve authenticity of existing testimonials and the single clean nav.

Keep product transparency: show agents, inputs, outputs, runtime.

This brief is the source of truth. If a decision is not specified, choose the option that looks most professional and minimal, then document it in the README so we can review quickly.

Done! I dropped a complete, developer-ready redesign brief into the canvas for you. It covers brand system, layout, components, motion, accessibility, product pages, FifthRow run states, SEO, performance targets, QA checklist, and deliverables — all tailored to your stack (React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui).
